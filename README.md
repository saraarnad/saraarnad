## McDaginn 🥰🇮🇸

🙋‍♀️ I'm Sara, a Software Engineer who hasn't been very active on GitHub/LinkedIn, but I'm stepping up now that I've started my own startup, Kuratech.

👩🏼‍💻 I'm a full-stack engineer with a broad range of experience across various domains in software development.

👷‍♀️ Currently working with Next.js and exploring artificial intelligence in legal tech.

🏊🏼‍♀️🚴🏻‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️ When I'm not coding, you can find me pushing my limits in the world of triathlons.
